# PluralDictionary

PluralDictionary website rewritten in React with Gatsby.

## Why?

The original website is a pain to work with. You can't link specific terms to people using, say, `#term`.

This is a feature I'd love to have, so I'm working on rewriting the entire website into a more comfortable browsing/development experience.
